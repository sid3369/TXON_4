                            <p> Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
                            <br>
                            The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:
                            <br>
                            Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.

                    <li> <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                         <p>Mobile application development creates software for digital assistants and smartphones. Users can access the software on their device through a mobile web browser or download it from a mobile app store. The programming languages used for such software include HTML5, C#, Java, and Swift.
                            <br>
                        Today, mobile devices and applications provide the most convenient way for companies to connect to the internet. To stay responsive, businesses need to develop mobile applications that their employees, partners, and customers demand.</p>

                        <p>
                            The process of software prototyping creates incomplete versions of an application for its progressive improvement. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to the prototyping generally performed in mechanical and manufacturing fields. Typically, a software prototype only executes a few of the required features. IT can also be significantly different from the final product. 
                            <br>
                            The benefit of prototyping is that developers obtain regular user feedback early in the project. Both users and developers can easily determine how well the prototype fits the software specifications used to build a prototype. Moreover, project managers can ensure that their initial milestones and deadlines are realistic.
